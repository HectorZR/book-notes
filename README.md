# Book Notes App

The idea behind this app is to keep a digital record of what books I am reading.

But, why? Does not a simple notes app work for you?
No, it does not. Because I read a lot and I have a lot of book currently reading.

So I wanted to keep this record organized and easy to search later.
Even you can add important notes about the book you are reading to search later.
Let you knowing where it is that what you read a long time ago and you need now.

Of course, ebooks let you do that, the bookmarks.
But this means having notes spread for every book and I wanted to keep those in one place.

## Under development

This app is currently under development and I want to make it available for anyone in any platform.
That is why I am using Golang.
